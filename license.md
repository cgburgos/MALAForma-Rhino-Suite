### EXHIBIT A

BETA TEST PLAN
Since the scope of this beta testing is explorative, the beta test plans consist on informal discussions about the product and interviews that will be arranged on time. For understanding the objectives of this research, the Licensee shall have on consideration the following four questions:

1. Is this a useful product?
2. Is this product stable?
3. What is missing on the product?
4. Is this product to complicated to use?

The measures will be undisclosed, but the results might be shared by the Vendor. By the end of the Beta Program the vendor will publish Beta Test completion form that the Licensee will answer to the extends of its possibilities.
